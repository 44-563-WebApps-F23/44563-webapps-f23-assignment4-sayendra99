       <h6  id="name"> BERTA.</h6>

       <p id="directions"> [Also softly.]</p>
       <p id="speech"> I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
        in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
        young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p>

      <h6 id="name"> MISS TESMAN.</h6> 

      <p id="speech">Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a

    <p><h6 id="name">MISS TESMAN.</h6>

       <p id="speech"> So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
        wrench to me to part with you. </p>

       <p id="speech"> We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
        George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
        to look after him ever since he was a little boy.</p>
