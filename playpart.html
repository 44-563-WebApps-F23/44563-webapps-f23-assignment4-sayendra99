        <h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>
<p>
    <p>[Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:]</p> Upon my word, I
    don't believe they are stirring yet</p>
 </p>
    <p>
       <h6> BERTA.</h6>

       <p> [Also softly.]</p><p> I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
        in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
        young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p>
           
    </p>
    <p>
      <h6> MISS TESMAN.</h6> 

      <p>Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
        good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.</p>

         <p>[She goes to the glass door and throws it open.]</p>

       <h6> BERTA.
    </h6>
        <p>[Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]</p>
        <p>I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
            Miss.</p>  <p>[She places it on the piano.]</p>
          
    </p>
    <p><h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>

       <p> So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
        wrench to me to part with you. </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h6> BERTA.
    </h6> 
        <p>[On the point of weeping.]</p> <p>And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
            Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)</p>

        <h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>

       <p> We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
        George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
        to look after him ever since he was a little boy.</p>
